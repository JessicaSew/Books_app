      "new_review": "The Paper Palace - My goodness… I loved this book! Perfect to read right now too.. A family that has dealt with some devastating history. There’s so much more to this story then what the synopsis states.. so many layers ..so much that many of these characters have endured. You’ll laugh, gasp, feel enraged.. so many emotions. Perfect read for me! Oh… and just beautiful descriptions of the land and sea!",
